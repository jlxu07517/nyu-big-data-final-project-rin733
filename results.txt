Params:
    rank_list = [90, 110, 120, 130, 140, 150]
    regParam_list = [0.1, 0.05, 0.01]
    alpha_list = [0.5, 1, 2]

Training on train_sub:
    Higher rank, higher alpha (2), higher regParam (0.1) --> higher MAP

Next step:
1) try higher alpha: e.g. 3, 4, ...
2) try higher regParam: e.g., 0.5, 1, ...
3) try log2 without turning into integer

Results:
1) For the training data, after comparing the validation results of three approaches of handling the count data: convert all count where count <=1 to 0; take log2 and turn into integer; take log2 without turning into integer, we found that the first approach(drop one) has greatly improved MAP on validation set.

2)For hyperparameter tuning: currently the best results comes from rank = 150, regParam = 0.3, alpha = 4 with dropone method with MAP = 0.040840226926259666 but the performance has not plateaued. We may continue to raise these parameters.
