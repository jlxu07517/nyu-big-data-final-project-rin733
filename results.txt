recSys test

Params:
    rank_list = [90, 110, 120, 130, 140, 150]
    regParam_list = [0.1, 0.05, 0.01]
    alpha_list = [0.5, 1, 2]

Training on train_sub:
    Higher rank, higher alpha (2), higher regParam (0.1) --> higher MAP

Next step:
1) try higher alpha: e.g. 3, 4, ...
2) try higher regParam: e.g., 0.5, 1, ...
3) try log2 without turning into integer
